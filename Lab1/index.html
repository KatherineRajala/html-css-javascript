                        <p>
                            Hello! My name is <strong>Katherine Rajala</strong>. I have studied <strong>Mechanical&nbsp;Engineering</strong> 
                            at <em>Linköping University</em> and I am a very driven and goal-oriented person who always 
                            enjoys learning new things. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently I am working at <strong>Volvo Cars</strong> as a System Designer, which involves talking to different
                            stakeholders to ensure that they fulfill our needs to achieve a safe working function.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On my spare time, I
                            tend to draw, play computer games, read books or go to the gym.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My main future goal is to get into the software development industry by learning required skills in
                            for example frontend and backend.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here are some programming languages or other programs that I am familiar with:
